About Tree Data Structures

- trees versus hashes (we need range operations, which are lacking in hashes)

- most trees are organzized along one dimension of search

(TBD: add lots of links to background material on wikipedia et. al.)

Operations

Dynamic set operations, in time proportional to the height of the tree.

    * search
    * predecessor
    * successor
    * minimum
    * maximum
    * insert
    * delete 

Balanced versus Unbalanced

A balanced tree has a height "log n" where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The objective of balancing is to minimize the number of levels in the tree in order to obtain the best running time.

Types of Trees

binary-tree?
    has at most two child nodes per node 
red-black?
    ??? 
AVL
    ??? 
b-tree
    has more than two child nodes per node 
quad?
    ??? 
K-dimensional?
    ??? 

Caching

Large trees often cannot all be held in primary storage (RAM) at one time. Instead a virtualization of storage, by combining an in-memory cache with secondary storage is used in these cases. Optimizing the number of nodes becomes more important with splitting storage across primary and secondary.

Mutability versus Immutability

Concurrency Issues
