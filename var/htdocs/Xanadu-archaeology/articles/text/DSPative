Whiteboard: DSPative    	  last revised by 127.0.0.1 on Aug 17, 2005 2:31 am     	
		

See EnfiladeTheory for a hint. DSPative is the correct spelling, not "DSPatibility?" as it appears there.

(Sorry, there may have been a page called "General Enfilade Theory" that had "DSPatibility?" in it, but the link here was broken and I can't find such a page. In the EnfiladeTheory page DSPs? are called "disps," and DSPative is spelled dispative, my bads. --SteveWitham? )
