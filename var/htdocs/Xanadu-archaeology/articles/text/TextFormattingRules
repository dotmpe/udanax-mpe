Whiteboard: TextFormattingRules    	  last revised by 127.0.0.1 on Aug 17, 2005 3:48 am     	
		

Your text is formatted as a web page according to some simple markup rules. These are intended to be convenient and unobtrusive.

The StructuredTextRules are used by default. Briefly -

    * separate paragraphs with a blank line
    * a single-line paragraph followed by a more-indented paragraph makes a heading
    * for bulleted/numbered lists, use * or 0. followed by a space
    * for emphasis, use ... and ...

Also -

    * WikiName(s), bare urls and words enclosed in square brackets are converted to hyperlinks (prepend the link or the line with ! to prevent this)
    * HTML & DTML tags may be used
